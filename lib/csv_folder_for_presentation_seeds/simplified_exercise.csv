Pause at the top of the movement. Do not lock out your knees and ensure that they are not bowing out or in.
While inhaling, return the footplate to the starting position by gradually bending the knees. Keep the feet and back flat throughout."

Engaging the muscles in your arms and back, bend your elbows and raise your upper body up toward the bar until your chin is over the bar.
